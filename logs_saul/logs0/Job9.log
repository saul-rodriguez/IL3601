WARNING (ADE-3079): Simulation is complete; however, simulation results are currently unavailable.
        This may be due to file system delay in reading the simulation data.
        You can specify a timeout value after which results should be made available.
        For this, set one of the following environment variables in your .cdsinit file:
        - tryNFSSync (if host system is remote)
        - tryNFSSyncLocal (if host system is local)
        If the issue persists, contact Cadence customer support for assistance.
