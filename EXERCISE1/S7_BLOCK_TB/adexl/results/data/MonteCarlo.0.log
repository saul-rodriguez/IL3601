Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
EXERCISE1:S7_BLOCK_TB:1	Nominal - 
	dB20(IF("/IPRB0/PLUS")):	Yield	0%
		Min 0	Max 0	Mean 0	Number of errors 39

EXERCISE1:S7_BLOCK_TB:1
	Overall Yield	0%	Number of points passed	0	Total number of points	39

Estimated yield = 0% (0/39), 39 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 0% (0/39)
